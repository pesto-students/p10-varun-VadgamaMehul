1.User Interface: The user interface is the visual component of the browser that users interact with. It includes the address bar, navigation buttons, bookmarks, and other user interface elements.


2.Address bar: The address bar allows users to enter a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) or search query to access websites or search for information.

3.Navigation buttons: The navigation buttons allow users to navigate back and forth between web pages, refresh pages, and stop loading pages.

4.Tabbed Browsing: Tabbed browsing allows users to open multiple web pages in a single window, making it easy to switch between them.

5.Rendering Engine/Parser: The rendering engine or parser is responsible for interpreting the HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) code of a web page and displaying it in a visually appealing way.

6.Network Communication: The network component is responsible for communicating with web servers and retrieving web page content.

7.JavaScript Engine: The JavaScript engine executes the JavaScript code on a web page, allowing for interactive and dynamic content.

8.Data Storage/Cache: The browser stores information such as cookies, cached data, and browsing history to improve the user experience and provide faster access to frequently visited websites.

The high-level components of a browser are:
User Interface: this is the part of the browser that the user interacts with, such as the address bar, tabs, and buttons.

* Browser Engine: this component coordinates the actions between the User Interface and the Rendering Engine.

* Rendering Engine: this component is responsible for rendering the requested content, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* Networking: this component handles the network communication, such as making HTTP requests and receiving responses.

* Data Storage: this component manages the browser's cache, cookies, and other types of storage.

* JavaScript Interpreter: this component executes JavaScript code on web pages.

* User Agent: this component identifies the browser to the web server, and it can also send additional information about the user's system and preferences.

**C. Rendering engine and its use.** 

![Screenshot-2019-11-12-at-3 26 19-PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127029826/224491010-48a5f382-5e1e-46dd-9181-b68a80d2853d.png)

A rendering engine is a software component that is responsible for rendering the content of a webpage or application on a user's device. It is an essential component of any web browser or application that displays web content, such as a mobile app or a game.

When a user requests a webpage or content, the rendering engine parses the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and creates a visual representation of the content. It determines how the content should be laid out, what fonts and colors should be used, and how user interactions should be handled.

There are several rendering engines available, including:

* Blink - used by Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers
* Gecko - used by Mozilla Firefox
* WebKit - used by Apple Safari and some other browsers

The use of a rendering engine is important because it allows web developers to create rich and interactive user interfaces, and to display content in a visually appealing way. By using a rendering engine, developers can ensure that their web content will be displayed consistently across different devices and browsers, and can take advantage of the latest web technologies and standards to create more engaging and interactive experiences for users

**D. Parsers (HTML, CSS, etc)**

ANS:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127029826/224491319-7fb8f9f5-9f70-417e-a314-c00b047977fa.png)

Parsers are programs that analyze and interpret code in a specific programming language or markup language, such as HTML or CSS. Parsers are used by web browsers, compilers, and other software tools to understand and process code written in these languages.

Here are some examples of parsers for popular web languages:

* HTML Parser: An HTML parser is a program that reads HTML code and converts it into a structured representation, typically a tree structure called the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM allows web browsers to manipulate HTML elements and their attributes programmatically.

* CSS Parser: A CSS parser reads CSS code and converts it into a structured representation that can be used to apply styles to HTML elements. This representation is typically a set of rules that describe how different elements should be styled.

* JavaScript Parser: A JavaScript parser is a program that reads JavaScript code and converts it into an executable form that can be run by a web browser or other JavaScript engine. This involves analyzing the code for syntax errors and resolving references to functions and variables.

* XML Parser: An XML parser reads XML code and converts it into a structured representation that can be used to manipulate the data in the XML document. This representation is typically a tree structure called the Document Object Model (DOM).

Parsers are an essential component of web development and programming in general, as they enable software tools to understand and manipulate code written in various languages.

**E. Script Processors**

ANS:

A script processor, also known as a scripting engine or interpreter, is a software component that executes scripts written in a particular scripting language. Scripting languages are programming languages that are often used for automation, rapid application development, and website scripting.

Script processors are typically used to execute scripts in web browsers, on servers, or in other software applications. They can be standalone programs, embedded in other applications, or provided as part of an operating system.

Some common scripting languages that are often executed using script processors include JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, and Bash. These languages are often used for web development, system administration, and automation tasks.

Script processors can be used to create interactive web applications, automate system administration tasks, and perform data analysis and manipulation. They are an important tool for developers and system administrators who need to quickly write and execute code to accomplish specific tasks.

**F. Tree construction**

Ans:

Tree construction is the process of building a DOM tree from the parsed HTML code. The DOM tree represents the structure of the web page, including the hierarchy of HTML elements, their attributes, and their content.

***

**G. Order of script processing**

Ans:

When running a script or program, the general order of processing is as follows:

* Preprocessing phase: This phase involves any preprocessing directives that may exist in the script, such as include statements, macros, or conditional compilation statements. These directives are processed by the preprocessor, which generates an intermediate version of the script that can be compiled.

* Compilation phase: In this phase, the compiler takes the intermediate version of the script generated by the preprocessor and generates machine code or bytecode that can be executed by the computer. During this phase, the compiler checks for syntax errors and performs various optimizations to improve the performance of the resulting code.

* Linking phase: If the script includes calls to external libraries or other modules, the linking phase will link the compiled code with these external dependencies. This phase resolves all references to external symbols and generates a final executable file or library that can be run or used by other programs.

* Execution phase: Once the executable code is generated, the script can be executed by the computer. During this phase, the operating system loads the executable code into memory, sets up the necessary environment, and starts executing the code.

It's worth noting that the exact details of script processing can vary depending on the programming language, operating system, and other factors. Additionally, some programming languages, such as interpreted languages, may skip the compilation and linking phases altogether and execute the code directly from the source.

**H. Layout and Painting**

Ans:

Layout and painting are the final steps in rendering a web page. Layout is the process of determining the size and position of each element on the page, based on its content and CSS styles. Painting is the process of filling in the pixels on the screen with the appropriate colors and images.
